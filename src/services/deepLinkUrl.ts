/**
 * The single declaration of trust:
 *
 * - `confirm` routes carry a capability and nothing happens until the user
 *   accepts.
 * - `attenuated` routes carry a real capability, worn down by scope, lifetime
 *   and blast radius until acting on it unprompted is safe. The bar is not "the
 *   link is probably genuine": it is that a forged link, tapped by the wrong
 *   person at the wrong moment, still costs the tapping user nothing.
 *
 *   `verified` is the only member, and is classified on the strongest form it
 *   could carry rather than the weakest form it carries today. Today the portal
 *   spends the verification token server-side and the app receives an inert
 *   user id, which would also satisfy `silent`; a mail link that opened the app
 *   directly would hand it the raw token instead. That capability is a
 *   single-use, short-lived token, bound server-side to one account, proving an
 *   address is reachable — no session, no key material, no grant. So a hostile
 *   `verified` link carries the *attacker's* own token: tapping it verifies the
 *   attacker's address, which the attacker can already do unaided, and touches
 *   nothing of the tapper's. A consent sheet on a tap the user asked for by
 *   pressing "verify my email" buys none of that back, and spends the user's
 *   willingness to read the sheets that do carry a capability.
 *
 *   The class stops being honest the moment a `verified` link carries something
 *   a forged one could spend *against* the tapper — a session, a wrapped key, an
 *   account-scoped grant. That route is `confirm`, not `attenuated`.
 *
 *   The stronger form stays hypothetical because mailing the raw token was
 *   considered and rejected. Enterprise rewriters (Outlook SafeLinks, Defender
 *   ATP) re-encode a mailed link onto their own logging host, so the tap
 *   resolves against *that* host: no App Link fires, the mail client's own
 *   browser follows the redirect, and the app never sees the link at all.
 *   Whether a fragment even survives that round trip is undocumented, while the
 *   one rewriter behaviour that is documented mangles query structure. A carrier
 *   that can silently drop the token is not worth what it would buy, which is
 *   one browser tab: the portal already hands the app a `verified` link the
 *   moment it succeeds.
 * - `silent` routes carry no capability at all and run a side effect unprompted.
 *   Currently unpopulated: it is the narrower claim `verified` used to make,
 *   kept for a route that genuinely carries nothing.
 * - `navigate` routes only move the user to a screen they could already reach.
 *   The worst a hostile link achieves is an unexpected panel, so they need no
 *   prompt — but they must never *act*: `billing` opens the account section and
 *   deliberately does not start a checkout.
